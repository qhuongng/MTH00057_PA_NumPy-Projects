# Exploring Image Processing Algorithms using NumPy
This repository contains two Jupyter notebooks, which were lab assignments for the course **MTH00057 - Applied Maths and Statistics** at VNUHCM - University of Science.

## Overview
The `kmeans` notebook implements a simple K-Means algorithm from scratch, including two methods of centroid generation, pixel labeling and centroid update. The complete algorithm is then used to perform color quantization on an image file.

The `imgproc` notebook explores different image processing algorithms by performing matrix operations. The algorithms include brightness and contrast adjustment, grayscale and sepia filters, blurring and sharpening, as well as flipping and cropping. The algorithms work on grayscale inputs and inputs with an alpha channel.

# How to run
The notebooks require [**Python**](https://www.python.org/downloads/), [**NumPy**](https://numpy.org/install/) and [**Matplotlib**](https://matplotlib.org/stable/users/getting_started/), as well as software/a text editor that supports Jupyter notebooks to run.
